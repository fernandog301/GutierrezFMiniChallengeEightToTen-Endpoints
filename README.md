Your code and logic is pretty sound, everything works properly and code is written very clean.

In the services file you should seperate the files with folders as it was kind of hard to find the actual logic

In your guessit, you should change the int to string so you can use tryparse to check if the user inputted a number, also the code does not check for if the user inputted a number above the limit.

(this is just my prefreneces)
One last thing is that you dont need the weatherforecast stuff it just clutters the explorer other than a few nitpicks everything is well coded!
